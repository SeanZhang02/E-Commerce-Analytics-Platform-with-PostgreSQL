# E-Commerce Analytics Platform

PostgreSQL-based analytics platform integrating multiple data sources for comprehensive business intelligence. Built using PostgreSQL 17 with advanced SQL techniques for real-time analytics and competitive intelligence.

## Technical Overview

This project demonstrates advanced SQL capabilities through a multi-schema analytics platform processing 1.3M+ records across three integrated data sources. The architecture prioritizes query performance and maintainability while solving real business problems.

### Core Technologies
- PostgreSQL 17 with enhanced CTE and window function capabilities
- Multi-schema architecture for data isolation and security
- Optimized indexing strategy achieving sub-second query execution
- Pure SQL implementation with no external dependencies

## SQL Techniques Demonstrated

### Window Functions and Analytics

The platform extensively uses window functions for time-series analysis and customer segmentation:

```sql
-- Year-over-year growth calculation using LAG()
WITH monthly_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
        SUM(unit_price * quantity * (1 - discount)) as revenue
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY 1
),
growth_analysis AS (
    SELECT 
        month,
        revenue,
        LAG(revenue, 12) OVER (ORDER BY month) as revenue_prev_year,
        (revenue - LAG(revenue, 12) OVER (ORDER BY month)) / 
        NULLIF(LAG(revenue, 12) OVER (ORDER BY month), 0) * 100 as yoy_growth
    FROM monthly_metrics
)
```

### Complex CTEs and Data Pipelines

Multi-level CTEs build sophisticated analytical pipelines:

```sql
-- Customer RFM segmentation with percentile ranking
WITH customer_base AS (
    -- Calculate base metrics
    SELECT customer_id,
           COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as frequency,
           SUM(unit_price * quantity * (1 - discount)) as monetary,
           MAX(order_date) as last_order_date
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
rfm_scores AS (
    -- Apply NTILE for quartile scoring
    SELECT *,
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY last_order_date DESC) as recency_score,
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) as frequency_score,
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY monetary DESC) as monetary_score
    FROM customer_base
),
segments AS (
    -- Business logic for customer classification
    SELECT *,
           CASE 
               WHEN recency_score >= 3 AND frequency_score >= 3 
                    AND monetary_score >= 3 THEN 'Champions'
               WHEN recency_score >= 2 AND frequency_score >= 2 
                    AND monetary_score >= 2 THEN 'Loyal Customers'
               -- Additional segmentation logic
           END as customer_segment
    FROM rfm_scores
)
```

### Cross-Schema Analysis

The platform performs joins across multiple schemas for competitive intelligence:

```sql
-- Price positioning analysis across data sources
SELECT 
    i.category_name,
    AVG(i.unit_price) as internal_avg_price,
    AVG(c.price_usd) as amazon_avg_price,
    ((AVG(c.price_usd) - AVG(i.unit_price)) / 
     NULLIF(AVG(i.unit_price), 0)) * 100 as price_gap_pct
FROM internal.products i
CROSS JOIN competitive.products c
WHERE LOWER(c.category_hierarchy) LIKE '%' || LOWER(i.category_name) || '%'
GROUP BY i.category_name;
```

### Data Transformation and ETL

Advanced SQL-based ETL processing handles complex data cleaning:

```sql
-- Amazon data import with transformation
INSERT INTO competitive.products (
    product_name,
    price_usd,
    rating,
    category_hierarchy
)
SELECT 
    TRIM(name),
    -- Currency conversion with error handling
    CASE 
        WHEN actual_price ~ '^\d+(\.\d+)?$' 
        THEN CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE(actual_price, '[^0-9.]', '', 'g') AS NUMERIC) / 83
        ELSE NULL
    END,
    -- Rating normalization
    COALESCE(
        CAST(NULLIF(REGEXP_REPLACE(rating, '[^0-9.]', '', 'g'), '') AS NUMERIC),
        0
    ),
    -- Category hierarchy parsing
    REGEXP_REPLACE(main_category, '\s+\|\s+', '|', 'g')
FROM staging.amazon_raw
WHERE name IS NOT NULL;
```

## Performance Metrics

## Architecture Design Decisions

### Schema Organization
The three-schema design provides clear separation of concerns:
- **internal**: Core transactional data with referential integrity
- **competitive**: External market data with flexible structure
- **industry**: Benchmark data for comparative analysis

### Index Strategy
Indexes were designed based on query access patterns:
```sql
-- Composite index for time-series queries
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date_customer 
ON orders(order_date, customer_id) 
INCLUDE (ship_country);

-- Partial index for active products
CREATE INDEX idx_products_active 
ON products(unit_price) 
WHERE NOT discontinued;

-- BRIN index for large time-series data
CREATE INDEX idx_olist_order_date 
ON olist_orders USING BRIN(order_purchase_timestamp);
```

### Data Quality Controls
Built-in validation ensures data integrity:
- Foreign key constraints across all relationships
- CHECK constraints for business rules
- NOT NULL enforcement on critical fields
- Automated validation script with 20+ quality checks

## Key SQL Patterns Used

### Defensive Programming
```sql
-- Safe division with NULLIF
ROUND(revenue / NULLIF(previous_revenue, 0) - 1, 4) as growth_rate

-- COALESCE chains for data quality
COALESCE(actual_price, discount_price, list_price, 0) as final_price
```

### Performance Patterns
```sql
-- EXISTS instead of IN for better performance
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o 
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id 
    AND o.order_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
)

-- Index-friendly date filtering
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'::date 
  AND order_date < '2025-01-01'::date
```

### Business Logic Encapsulation
```sql
-- Reusable revenue calculation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_order_revenue(
    p_quantity INTEGER,
    p_unit_price NUMERIC,
    p_discount NUMERIC
) RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
    SELECT p_quantity * p_unit_price * (1 - COALESCE(p_discount, 0))
$$ LANGUAGE SQL IMMUTABLE;
```

## Testing and Validation

The platform includes comprehensive validation:
- Row count verification across all tables
- Referential integrity checks
- Business rule validation (negative prices, future dates)
- Data completeness metrics
- Cross-schema consistency verification
